# Code Name: Pentium Single Core

# Resources Used
[tchell](https://github.com/tchell/) created a bunch of tests that 
we have implemented into this repository (under tests/).

[There's a nice wiki](https://www.kayufu.com/gogui/rules.html) for implementing
the rules in gogui. I would recommend you let students build all these go rules 
themselves next time.

Martin Muller created Go0.py and Go1.py which we have reworked to
play Gomoku here.

# Notes
The presubmission.log is weird, idk if it's my computer or what
but there's a tone of character sequences in there.

For testing I ran:
    `../gogui/bin/gogui-regress "python ../Go0.py" tests/assignment1-public-tests.gtp`
